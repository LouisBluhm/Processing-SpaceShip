CONTROLS/INFO:

Ventura is a sci-fi/rpg game, inspired by 'FTL: Faster Than Light'. As the game is fairly short and there are
many different mechanics you may miss depending on your choices e.g. gaining more crew, I recommend you play
the game several times with difference choices to be able to see all the mechanics at work. 

The game also uses many random elements, so the look/events may be different each time. Good luck!

Q - Travel menu
W - Deploy dropship (charge energy cells)
M - Mute audio
N - Unmute audio

COMMENTS:

Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish everything to the standard I wanted, or root out every single bug encountered,
due to time constraints. But I think what I have so far works well and conforms to the marking criteria.

Warning! I had issues with my AMD GPU to do with Processing/Java. If you experiences crashes I would recommend
you try the program on a computer with a different gpu/OS. I have included builds for Windows 32/64 & Linux.
Run the code straight from the editor if you need to run it on Mac.
